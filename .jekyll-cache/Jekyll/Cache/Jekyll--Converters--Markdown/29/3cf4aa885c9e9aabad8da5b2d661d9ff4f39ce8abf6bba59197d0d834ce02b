I"œ<p>In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a cost of care prediction model and insights into Machine learning with Tensorflow.</p>

<p>We will build our  model in four simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1 - Build a TensorFlow development environment</li>
  <li>Step 2 - Setup our Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Step 3 - Build and train our machine learning model using linear regression</li>
  <li>Step 4 - We will publish our prediction model through an API using Flask</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing youâ€™ll need installed is Docker.</p>

<p>And you can download the code from Github by
following the link to the side</p>

<p>With that, lets get startedâ€¦</p>
