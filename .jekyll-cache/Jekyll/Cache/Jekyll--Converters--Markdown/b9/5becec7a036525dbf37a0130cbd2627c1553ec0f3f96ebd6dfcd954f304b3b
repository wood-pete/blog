I"ù<p>I speak to a lot of people about AI.  A lot of people.  The conversation usually goes something like this.</p>

<p><em>Hey,  I‚Äôve got a cool idea, we should use AI to look for INSERT FUNKY CLINICAL INSIGHT.</em></p>

<p><em>Great idea, have you got some data we can use to create a model?</em></p>

<p><em>Sure! I know at guy at INSERT FUNKY BUSINESS with some data we can borrow.</em></p>

<p><em>What format is the data in? Is it AI-Ready?</em></p>

<p><em>Eh, what? I‚Äôm sure we can just clean it up.</em></p>

<p>There‚Äôs that word again.  Just.  The single word that glosses over reality, and simplifies the World. Just. I decided to explore what it takes to build, train and publish a simple AI model from some fairly raw data. In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a simple ‚Äòcost of care‚Äô prediction model and gain experience with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>, Google‚Äôs open source software library for machine learning. I decided to explore the steps that it takes to go from zero to a fully trained published model. In this 5 minute video I‚Äôll show you the steps I had to take to create a blueprint for further investigation.</p>

<p>We will build our  model in four simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1 - Build a TensorFlow development environment</li>
  <li>Step 2 - Setup our Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Step 3 - Build and train our machine learning model using linear regression</li>
  <li>Step 4 - We will publish our prediction model through an API using Flask</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing you‚Äôll need installed is Docker, and code can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/fiveminutecloud/tensorflowdemo">GitHub</a>.</p>
