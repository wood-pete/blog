I"K<p>I speak to a lot of people about AI.  A lot of people.  The conversation usually goes something like this.</p>

<p>‘Hey,  I’ve got a cool idea, we should use AI to look for INSERT FUNKY INSIGHT.’</p>

<p>‘Great idea, have you got some data we can train?’</p>

<p>‘Sure! I know at guy at INSERT FUNKY BUSINESS with some data we can borrow.’</p>

<p>‘What format is the data in? Is it AI-Ready?’</p>

<p>‘Eh, what? I’m sure we can just clean it up.’</p>

<p>There’s that word again.  Just.  The single word that glosses over reality, and simplifies the world. Just.  It’s the word that I despise the most. 
I decided to explore what it takes to build, train and publish a simple AI model from some fairly raw data. In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a simple ‘cost of care’ prediction model and gain insights into Machine learning with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>, Google’s open source software library for machine learning. I decided to explore the steps that it takes to go from zero to a fully trained published model.</p>
