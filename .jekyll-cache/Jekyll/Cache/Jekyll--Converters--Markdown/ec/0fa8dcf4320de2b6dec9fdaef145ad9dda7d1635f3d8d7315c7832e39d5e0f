I"<p>I speak to a lot of people about AI. About the possibilities for healthcare, the limitations, the tools, and how the Cloud providers help us quickly build models. The conversation usually goes something like this.</p>

<p><em>Hey,  I’ve got a cool idea, we should use AI to look for INSERT FUNKY CLINICAL INSIGHT.</em></p>

<p><em>Great idea, have you got some data we can use to create a model?</em></p>

<p><em>Sure! I know at guy at INSERT FUNKY BUSINESS with some data we can borrow.</em></p>

<p><em>What format is the data in? Is it AI-Ready?</em></p>

<p><em>Eh, what? I’m sure we can just clean it up.</em></p>

<p>There’s that word again.  Just.  The single word that glosses over reality, and simplifies the World. Just. I decided to explore what it takes to build, train and publish a simple AI model from some fairly raw data. In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a simple ‘cost of care’ prediction model and gain experience with <a href="https://to.fiveminute.cloud/1r2xMz">TensorFlow</a>, Google’s open source software library for machine learning. I decided to explore the steps that it takes to go from zero to a fully trained published model. In this 5 minute video I’ll show you the steps I had to take to create a blueprint for further investigation.</p>

<p>We will build our  model in four simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1 - Build a TensorFlow development environment</li>
  <li>Step 2 - Setup our Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Step 3 - Build and train our machine learning model using linear regression</li>
  <li>Step 4 - We will publish our prediction model through an API using Flask</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing you’ll need installed is Docker, and code can be downloaded from <a href="https://to.fiveminute.cloud/ekxWeR">GitHub</a>.</p>
