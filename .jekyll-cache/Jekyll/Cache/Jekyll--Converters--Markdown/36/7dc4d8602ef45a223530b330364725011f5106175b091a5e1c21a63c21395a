I"Q<p>In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a cost of care prediction model and insights into Machine learning with Tensorflow.</p>

<p>We will build our  model in four simple steps:
Step 1 - Build a TensorFlow development environment
Step 2 - Setup our Jupyter notebook
Step 3 - Build and train our machine learning model using linear regression
Step 4 - We will publish our prediction model through an API using Flask</p>

<p>The only thing you’ll need installed is Docker.</p>

<p>And you can download the code from Github by
following the link to the side</p>

<p>With that, lets get started…</p>
