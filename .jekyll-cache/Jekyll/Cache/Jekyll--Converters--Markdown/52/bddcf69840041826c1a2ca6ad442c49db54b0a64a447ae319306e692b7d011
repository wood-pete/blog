I"Þ<p>I speak to a lot of people about AI.  A lot of people.  The conversation usually goes something like this.</p>

<p>â€˜Hey,  Iâ€™ve got a cool idea, we should use AI to look for INSERT FUNKY INSIGHTâ€™</p>

<p>â€˜Great idea, have you got some data we can trainâ€™</p>

<p>â€˜Sure! My mate at INSERT FUNKY BUSINESS has some data we can borrowâ€™</p>

<p>â€˜What format is the data in? Is it AI-Ready?â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Eh, what? Iâ€™m sure we can just clean it upâ€™</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s that word again.  Just.  The single word that glosses over reality, and simplifies the world. Just.  Itâ€™s the word that I despise the most. 
I decided to explore what it takes to build, train and publish a simple AI model from some fairly raw data. In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a simple â€˜cost of careâ€™ prediction model and gain insights into Machine learning with <a href="1">TensorFlow</a>  I decided to explore the steps that it takes to go from zero to a fully trained published model. We will build our  model in four simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1 - Build a TensorFlow development environment</li>
  <li>Step 2 - Setup our Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Step 3 - Build and train our machine learning model using linear regression</li>
  <li>Step 4 - We will publish our prediction model through an API using Flask</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing youâ€™ll need installed is Docker, and code can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/fiveminutecloud/tensorflowdemo">GitHub</a>.</p>
