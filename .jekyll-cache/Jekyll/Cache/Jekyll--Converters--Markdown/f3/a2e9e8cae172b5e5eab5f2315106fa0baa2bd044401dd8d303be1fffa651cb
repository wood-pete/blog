I"$<p>I speak to a lot of people about AI. About the possibilities for healthcare, the limitations, the tools, and how the Cloud providers help us quickly build models. I decided to explore what it takes to build, train and publish a simple AI model to predict a patient’s insurance charges. In this 5 minute video, I explore how to create a simple ‘cost of care’ prediction model and gain experience with <a href="https://to.fiveminute.cloud/1r2xMz">TensorFlow</a>, Google’s open source software library for machine learning with particular focus on training of deep neural networks. I decided to explore the steps that it takes to go from zero to a fully trained published model. In this 5 minute video I’ll show you the steps I had to take to create a blueprint for further investigation.</p>
